# Get the Raw Dataset from fastMRI

The initial goal is to obtain "healthy" Knee MRI images for the study of trochlea dysplasia. In the pathological dataset, PD fat-saturated sequences are mainly used for diagnosing Trochlear Dysplasia,
which is why we are also looking for these specific sequences in the fastMRI Dataset.

## Step A: Get Raw Dataset

1. **Download the raw dataset** from the [fastMRI website](https://fastmri.med.nyu.edu/).

2. There are two "batches":
    - The first tar.xz batch is 133GB.
    - The second batch is 29GB.

We look at the fastMRI "second batch" only, because only there are "PD Axial Fat Sat" sequences also used in the Children's University Hospital Basel.
